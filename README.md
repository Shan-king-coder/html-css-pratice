# HTML & CSS Practice

This repository contains practice projects built while learning front-end development.

## About Me
I am a healthcare professional transitioning into front-end development.  
I work with HTML and CSS and I’m currently exploring advanced CSS concepts to build clean, responsive, and human-centered interfaces.

## What I'm Practicing
- Semantic HTML
- Modern CSS layouts (Flexbox & Grid)
- Responsive design
- Clean UI structure

More projects coming as I learn.
